              Determining whether people are happy has always been a complex and challenging issue, both in the past and present. This is because happiness is a highly subjective experience that is difficult to measure using objective criteria. Moreover, happiness can be influenced by a variety of factors, including social, economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. Despite these challenges, the pursuit of happiness remains a fundamental human goal, and understanding the factors that contribute to happiness is critical for promoting human prosperity and well-being. The goal of this project is to track the happiness score of residents through data visualization and identify ways to improve resident happiness.

              The project utilizes three different datasets for subsequent data analysis. The first dataset, WorldHappiness_Corruption_2015_2020.csv from <b

                </b>, provides 13 variables, including GDP, income, life expectancy, and the extent to which corruption contributes to the happiness score calculation. The second dataset, life_ladder.xls from <b
              ><a href="https://worldhappiness.report/">World Happiness Report</a>
                </b>, contains specific information on the average happiness score for each country from 2005 to 2021. Note that the happiness score ranges from 0 to 10 and is based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. Additionally, it provides data on the social support received by citizens in each country. The third dataset, world_bank.csv, is from the <b
              ><a href="https://databank.worldbank.org/happiness-data/id/1d38fdc3">World Bank website</a>
                </b>and includes 9 variables. It provides annual information on CO2 emissions, income levels, population, and unemployment rates for each country. These datasets will be merged and cleaned to obtain a clearer dataset for subsequent data visualization, covering the years 2008 to 2021.  The image below summarizes the process of forming our dataset, and more details about this dataset will be presented in the Methods section.

          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            Before delving into the various factors affecting happiness scores, it is important to first review how 
            the worldwide happiness score has changed over the past decade. This knowledge is critical in establishing a 
            baseline understanding and in comprehending how each country's happiness score changes over time. 
            Figure 1 shows this through an innovative plot that displays changes in happiness scores from 2008 to 2021. 
            The innovative aspect involves dividing the happiness score into three levels using three emojis. The division 
            rule is based on the distribution of the happiness score, with one-third and two-thirds of the counts 
            determining the levels. The plot uses the "🥰" emoji to indicate a score higher than 6, "🤖" to indicate a score 
            between 4.5 and 6, and "🤢" to indicate a score below 4.5. 
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            The graph demonstrates that developed countries generally have higher happiness scores than developing countries over time. Countries in Asia tend to have neutral happiness scores, while those in Oceania, Europe, and North America are generally happy. In contrast, many countries in Africa seem to have unhappy or neutral scores. For instance, "Tanzania" has had unhappy scores ("🤢") over time.

          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            Since there are around 140 countries, it is difficult to visualize and analyze the happiness score of each country.
            Therefore, in Figure 2, we will visualize the happiness score in different continents over a period of time.
          
          </p>

              different continents from 2008 to 2021, with each continent represented by a different color. Hovering over it will
              show the quartile value, and clicking on the legend allows you to select a continent. </p>
            </center>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            Figure 2 shows that except for 2013, the maximum happiness score was observed in North America, but the difference in
            the score was only 0.01 compared to Europe. In all other years, the maximum happiness score was consistently observed
            in Europe. In 2008, the maximum value was almost 8, which is the highest among these continents from 2008 to 2021.
          
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            Regarding the minimum happiness score, before 2017, it was always in Africa. However, after 2016, the minimum
            happiness score in Asia became lower than that in Africa. In 2021, the minimum happiness score even reached 2.18,
            which is the lowest value recorded among these continents during the entire period.
          
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            The overall trend suggests that there have not been significant changes in happiness scores across different years.
            This means that over time, happiness scores do not change too much, although there may be some fluctuations.
            Therefore, for further analysis, we will use the mean happiness score of a continent within a period to represent the
            happiness score in that continent.
          
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            In general, how do happiness scores differ across continents? Therefore, we compare the average happiness score of
            each continent (Figure 3) to see which continent is happier.

            There are many factors that affect happiness, and people experience happiness differently. For example, some people may be influenced by their living environment, physical or mental health, income, savings, and so on. Therefore, what is the difference in the happiness score of people living in different places? The bar chart above (Figure 3) illustrates the happiness score of each continent.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            Using the bar chart, it is evident which continent has the highest and lowest happiness scores. The average happiness score of each continent, from highest to lowest, is Oceania, North America, Europe, South America, Asia, and Africa (as depicted in Figure 3). The ranking may be influenced by various factors, such as environment, socioeconomics, education, and so forth. For instance, the lower happiness score in many African countries (ranked at the bottom of the six continents) may be attributed to poverty and political instability, leading to negative feelings and a relatively low average happiness score of only about 4.3.

            In Figure 3, the happiness scores are compared across continents. But, how do happiness scores differ across countries? Therefore, in Figure 4, two countries from each continent are selected for comparison: Canada and the United States in North America, the United Kingdom and France in Europe, China and Japan in Asia, New Zealand and Australia in Oceania, Morocco and Niger in Africa, and Panama and Colombia in South America.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            Figure 4 consists of two charts. The bar chart shows the average happiness scores for the 12 selected countries, with Canada (North America) having the highest happiness score, followed by New Zealand (Oceania). It is interesting to note that while Figure 3 shows that Oceania has the highest happiness score among the continents, in Figure 4, the country with the highest happiness score is Canada from North America. This suggests that if a country exists on a continent with a lower happiness score than other continents, the happiness score of this country may be higher than that of the countries on other continents.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            The line graph in Figure 4 shows that the happiness scores of most countries are relatively stable over time, but there is a clear upward trend in the happiness score of Niger from 2015 to 2018. Niger's happiness score in 2018 was more than 1 point higher than its happiness score in 2015, indicating a significant improvement in happiness in a short period.

          Apart from the positive correlations, the two variables with the highest negative correlation with Happiness Score are
          Perceptions of Corruption and Negative Affect, with values of -0.46 and -0.29, respectively. Negative correlation
          value means that as the values of these variables increase, the Happiness Score will decrease.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          Furthermore, the variables CO2 emissions, year, total population, and confidence show little or no correlation with
          the Happiness Score, with an absolute correlation value below 0.1.
        
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          Moreover, this plot indicates that the variables highly correlated with the Happiness Score, with values higher than
          0.7, are also highly correlated with each other, with a correlation value among them higher than 0.6.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          After analyzing the relationship between each variable and the Happiness Score through the correlation coefficient
          value, it is reasonable and necessary to select some factors for further investigation into how they affect the
          happiness score.

            Negative Affect across different continents from 2008 to 2022. Positive Affect represents the average of laughter
            and enjoyment experienced the day before, while Negative Affect represents the average of three negative emotions:
            worry, sadness, and anger experienced the day before. Hovering over the plot will show more information, and the
            continents can be selected through the legend.</p>
        </center>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          Figure 6 analyzes the Happiness Score from a personal aspect, with the variables Positive Affect and Negative Affect
          focusing on people's feelings in the previous day. From Figure 6, it is observed that Positive Affect values are
          generally higher than Negative Affect values across all continents, with fluctuations rather than an overall increase
          over time. North America, South America, and Oceania have higher Positive Affect values than the other three
          continents.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          Regarding Negative Affect, except for Oceania, all continents' values increase to varying degrees. In Africa, the
          minimum value was 0.187 in 2009, while the maximum value was 0.343 in 2018, which has the biggest difference among
          these continents. In South America, although the Positive Affect value is the highest among these continents, the
          Negative Affect value is also the highest, indicating significant differences in people's feelings in South America.
        
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          The number of people with positive values and negative feelings is high, which may explain why the mean Happiness
          Score in South America is not the highest. On the other hand, Oceania has the highest mean Happiness Scores with the
          highest Positive Affect value and almost the lowest Negative Affect value.

It can be observed that Africa has the lowest correlation, with the trendline appearing almost horizontal.
        </p></center>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          Is the freedom to make life choices related to happiness in different continents? According to the heatmap, there is a correlation of higher than 0.5 between the freedom to make life choices and happiness score. Therefore, Figure 7 demonstrates the correlation between freedom of choice in life across different continents.

        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          In the scatter plot, we can clearly see a trend of concentration from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. From the trendline of the scatter plot, we can observe a positive correlation between the freedom to make life choices and the happiness score in each continent. This means that the higher the freedom value, the higher the happiness score. Upon examining the correlation for each continent, we can see that Africa has the lowest correlation between freedom and happiness scores, while Europe has the highest correlation (as demonstrated by the skew of the trendline).

        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          Overall, the freedom to make choices is correlated with happiness scores. However, the effect varies across different graphs, including in Africa where the correlation tends to be almost zero (as depicted by the almost horizontal trendline in Figure 7). Therefore, the freedom to make life choices is one of the factors that determine happiness scores.

          Can Money Buy Happiness?</font></i>
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          The use of money, as measured by GDP per capita, is one of the primary variables to consider when investigating whether it can buy happiness, as this has been a contentious topic. While some contend that money is the key to happiness, others argue that it cannot buy happiness. Thus, this section seeks to examine the correlation between happiness and money through the GDP per capita metric.

        </p></center>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          A bubble plot was used for data visualization, displaying the relationship between the average annual happiness score and GDP per capita for all countries in the world. The analysis was further grouped by continents to identify potential characteristics among them. The size of the bubble was determined by the population of the country, where larger bubbles represented more populous countries. Figure 8 illustrates a clear positive correlation between GDP per capita and happiness from 2008 to 2021. Europe has consistently maintained high happiness levels and high GDP per capita, with countries such as Denmark and Finland exemplifying this trend. On the other hand, Africa is typically located in the lower-left corner of the graph, suggesting that people there are generally less happy and have limited financial resources. Overall, this visualization answers the controversial topic of whether money can buy happiness, as it enables the audience to easily comprehend the direct relationship between money and happiness. However, while money can contribute to happiness, it may not be the sole determinant. Thus, other potential factors will be explored in the following analysis.

          Does government behavior affect happiness scores?</font></i>
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          In addition to the factors considered earlier in terms of personal and economic considerations, what other factors affect people's happiness scores? To consider this question in terms of government behavior, we can examine the relationship between the happiness score and the factors of social support, health, confidence, and corruption in government. To achieve this, we created a data visualization with a parallel coordinate chart to analyze the correlations between these variables, as shown in Figure 9.

        </p>
        <center><iframe src="../img/Parallel_plot.html"  width="80%" height="450"></iframe></center>
        <center><p style="font-size: 0.85rem; width: 80%"> Figure 9: The parallel coordinate chart is created by grouping the data by continent and year, with each line representing a continent for each year. It displays clear positive relationships between the happiness score, social support, and health. A slight pattern is observed in corruption, indicating that higher corruption leads to lower happiness scores. However, no clear pattern is observed in the confidence level of the national government. The color scheme represents the happiness score, with green indicating happiness, yellow indicating neutrality, and red indicating unhappiness. The plot is interactive, allowing users to drag the lines along the axes to filter regions and drag the axis names across the plot to rearrange variables.
        </p></center>

        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          The means of each variable are calculated by grouping the data by continent and year. The resulting chart (Figure 9) shows each continent for each year as a line that connects the values of each dimension. The color of the line is determined by the continent's average happiness score. Values between 6 and 10 represent happiness and are shown in green, values between 4.5 and 6 represent neutrality and are shown in yellow, and values below 4.5 represent unhappiness and are shown in red. The chart has five dimensions. The first dimension, social support, measures the degree to which people feel they have someone to rely on in times of need. The second dimension, health, measures the number of years a person is expected to be in good health. The third dimension, confidence in the national government, measures how much people trust their government. The fourth dimension, corruption, measures the perception of corruption by the people. The final dimension is the happiness score, which measures the overall average happiness score of the continent.

        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          The chart enables us to visually explore the relationship between four variables and the happiness score. It reveals that continents with higher levels of social support and health tend to have higher levels of happiness, supporting the idea that social support and health play significant roles in determining happiness levels. However, in terms of government corruption, a slight pattern shows that higher corruption leads to lower happiness scores, suggesting that these two variables have a negative relationship. On the other hand, the level of confidence in the government does not have a significant relationship with happiness, as continents with higher confidence in their government do not necessarily have higher levels of happiness. The data on this dimension show a lot of heterogeneity, indicating that the relationship between confidence in the national government and happiness is not straightforward.

          What are the Components of Happiness?</font></i>
        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          In the previous plots, seven selected variables are analyzed in detail to examine their correlation with the happiness score. In the following plots, a radar plot is created using five variables that are positively correlated with happiness scores.

        </p>
        <center><iframe src="../img/happiness_score(radar&bar).html"  width="89%" height="400"></iframe></center>
        <center><p style="font-size: 0.85rem; width: 89%"> Figure 10: The Radar Plot & Bar Chart indicate the components of happiness and their average happiness scores across different continents. The radar plot shows the five components of happiness: "Social Support", "Health", "Freedom", "Generosity", and "Log GDP", all of which are normalized between 0 and 1. The bar chart displays the happiness scores of the five continents. By clicking on a continent in the legend, users can hide or display the corresponding shapes in the radar plot and bar chart.
        </p></center>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          The smallest area on the radar plot is observed in Africa, and the largest area on the radar plot is observed in Oceania. The lowest happiness score on the bar chart is in Africa, and the highest happiness score on the bar chart is in Oceania. The plots indicate that the larger the area, the higher the happiness score. 

        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
          Based on these plots, it can be concluded that "Social Support," "Health," "Freedom," "Log GDP," and "Generosity" have positive impacts on the happiness score. The higher the value of these components, the happier the residents of the continent will be. Therefore, African countries need to work on improving these aspects, while South America and Europe need to increase their level of "Generosity" to enhance the happiness of their residents.

            Conclusion</font>
          </h2>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            In summary, happiness is a complex and subjective concept that is influenced by a variety of factors. This project uses data visualization techniques to explore the factors that contribute to national happiness. From an overall perspective, continents such as Oceania, Europe, and North America generally have higher happiness scores than other continents. So why do these continents have higher happiness scores? The findings suggest a complex interplay between happiness and personal, economic, and governmental factors.

          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            From an individual perspective, the degree of freedom to make life choices is strongly correlated with happiness, and people who have more freedom to live tend to be happier (Figure 7). From an economic perspective, there is a strong correlation between GDP per capita and the happiness score. Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have happier citizens (Figure 8). From a government perspective, government policies play a critical role in promoting happiness, particularly in the areas of health care, support for people, and government corruption. Countries with higher levels of social support, greater access to health care and more equitable distribution of resources, and less corruption tend to have happier citizens (Figure 9).

          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.02rem;">
            Thus, the three continents of Oceania, Europe, and North America excel in these areas, so their regions lead the other continents in happiness. Overall, the pursuit of happiness is the goal of human life. For individuals, enjoy life and focus on personal growth. On the economic front, governments can focus on promoting sustainable economic growth that benefits all members of society. In addition, governments can promote greater happiness and well-being by providing more policies for health care and other basic services, reducing corruption, and increasing government transparency. Through these measures, policymakers and individuals can better promote human prosperity and overall quality of life.
