## Abstract
Happiness is a crucial aspect of human life and well-being as it plays a vital role in our overall physical, emotional, and mental health. However, determining whether people are happy has always been a complex and challenging issue both in the past and present, due to its subjective nature and various influencing factors. The project aims to use data visualization techniques, including choropleth plots, box plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices, to explore the factors that contribute to countries' happiness and well-being. The findings show that Europe, Oceania, and North America generally have higher happiness scores than other continents. Furthermore, factors such as GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy are closely related to the happiness index. Overall, this project provides insight into the many facets of happiness and highlights the importance of understanding the factors that contribute to it.

## Repository structure

The repository has the following structure:

```.

```

* The `code/` directory is where we develop all our code, including Box Plot, HeatMap, Line Chart, Choropleth, Radar Chart, Bar Chart, Bubble Plot, Parallel  Plot, and Scatter Plot in Python and Data Table in R Language. 

* The `data/` directory contains our data files, which are three raw datasets and one combined dataset. 

* The `img/` directory contains all plots we made which are html files in order to easy for adding into website.

* The `website/` directory where the website is deployed, which is the report displayed.
